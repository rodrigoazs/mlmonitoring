# Concept drift or change in P(Y|X) is a shift in the actual relationship
# between the model inputs and the output. An example of 
# concept drift is when macroeconomic factors make lending 
# riskier, and there is a higher standard to be eligible 
# for a loan. In this case, an income level that was earlier 
# considered creditworthy is no longer creditworthy.
